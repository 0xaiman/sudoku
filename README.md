### Sudoku Solver

See the project --> https://sudoku-c9j.pages.dev/

This project aims to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles interactively. It allows users to input their solutions and checks them against the correct solution. Below are the key functionalities and sections of the project:

#### Generate Sudoku Array Section

This section contains functions to generate and shuffle Sudoku arrays. The `generateSudokuArray` function creates a valid Sudoku array with non-repeating numbers. The `shuffleArray` function randomizes the order of elements in the array. There are also functions to check the validity of rows and columns in the Sudoku array.

#### Answer Handling Section

In this section, users can input their answers to the Sudoku puzzle. The `inputToArray` function collects user input and converts it into an array format. The `checkAnswer` function compares the user's input with the correct solution and visually highlights correct and incorrect entries. The `showResult` function displays an alert indicating whether the user's solution is correct.

#### Main Logic

The main logic of the program is executed when the DOM content is loaded. It generates a Sudoku array, shuffles it, checks its validity, and then displays the puzzle grid with some cells pre-filled as clues for the user to solve.

#### User Interface

The user interface consists of a grid of input fields where users can input their solutions to the Sudoku puzzle. There's also a check button that users can click to verify their answers.

#### Clue Generation

The `clueStart` function generates clues by randomly filling some cells in the Sudoku grid with values from the solution array. This provides users with hints to help them solve the puzzle.

#### How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Wait for the Sudoku puzzle to load.
3. Fill in the empty cells with your answers.
4. Click the "Check" button to verify your solution.
5. If correct, you'll see a congratulatory message; otherwise, you'll be informed of the mistake.

#### Note

- The Sudoku array generation and solution checking algorithms are optimized for efficiency and accuracy.
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser to run the program effectively.
